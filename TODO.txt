Possible optimisations for book display:
1. Linear optimisation strategy
Only re-render books after the altered index. E.g. if a new book is added, then only rerender the new book.
If the book at index i is removed, then only re-render books from index i onwards.

Also, when read status is changed, only re-render that particular grid element.
